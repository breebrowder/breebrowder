# Hi there 👋
My name is Bree Browder. I am currently studying full stack web development at Holberton School Tulsa. The next several years will prove to be a very developmental time for me as an engineer, and I am so excited to be in the tech space. Though full stack, I favor mostly front-end development during this season of my life and have plans to continue cultivating my knowledge of back-end API's, databases, etc in the future.

I am a die hard ambivert. I am neither only an introvert or only an extrovert. Though, the people closest to me might suggest otherwise. I honor and value the relationships I have with the people I love.

While continuing to learn and later pursue a career in technology, I document blog posts about new things I learn occasionally. Check them out below!
